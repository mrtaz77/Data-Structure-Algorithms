## Introduction

Understanding data structures and algorithms is essential for building efficient and scalable software solutions. This repository aims to provide implementations of various data structures and algorithms to help developers deepen their understanding and enhance their problem-solving skills.

The repository covers a wide range of topics, including but not limited to:

- Array-based data structures (e.g., arrays, lists)
- Linked data structures (e.g., linked lists, stacks, queues)
- Trees (e.g., binary trees, AVL trees, heaps)
- Graphs (e.g., graph traversal algorithms, shortest path algorithms)
- Sorting and searching algorithms (e.g., bubble sort, merge sort, binary search)
- Dynamic programming algorithms
- Hashing and hash tables
- and more!

Each implementation includes detailed explanations and comments to facilitate understanding and make it easier to follow along. The code is organized into folders based on the programming language, allowing you to explore implementations in your preferred language.

## Folder Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

```
